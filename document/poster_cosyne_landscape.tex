  Sequence disambiguation or using past context to determine the trajectory of a sequence has been deemed one of themost important problems that a sequence prediction network should solve \cite{levy}. There have been a few attempts at the problem of sequence disambiguation in the attractor network framework but most of them rely on non-local learning rules or require an unfeasible large number of parameter. We present here a sequence learning system that works with probabilistic associative learning and is able to accomplish sequence disambiguation by using dynamical information in the form of synaptic traces.}

Based on previous work \cite{phil, us} we present network whose dynamical evolution is controlled by the equations below. The model contains a current $s$ for each unit that evolves according to the their interaction mediated by weights $\mathbf{W}$ and a bias term $\vec{\mathbf{\beta}}$. Furthermore, to induce an structured sequential transition the model is subjected to intrinsic adaptation $\vec{\mathbf{a}}$ and a mechanism of winner-takes-all given by a strict max in $\vec{\mathbf{o}}$.

\begin{align*}
\tau_s \dfrac{d \vec{s}}{dt} &=  \vec{\mathbf{\beta}} + \mathbf{W} \cdot \vec{\mathbf{z}}_{pre}  - g_a \vec{\mathbf{a}} - \vec{\mathbf{s}}  + \sigma d\vec{\mathbf{\xi}}(t) \\ 
 \tau_a \dfrac{d\vec{\mathbf{a}}}{dt} &= \vec{\mathbf{o}} - \vec{\mathbf{a}} \\ 
o_i &=   \begin{cases}
   1,&  s_i = \underset{hypercolumn}{\max}(\vec{\mathbf{s}}),\\
   0 ,& \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\ 
 \tau_{z_{pre}} \dfrac{d\vec{\mathbf{\mathbf{z}}}_{pre}}{dt} &= \vec{\mathbf{o}} - \vec{\mathbf{z}}_{pre} \\ 
\tau_{z_{post}} \dfrac{d \vec{\mathbf{z}}_{post}}{dt} &= \vec{\mathbf{o}} - \vec{\mathbf{z}}_{post} 
\label{eq:dynamics}

As a learning rule we use the Bayesian Confidence Propagator Neural Netowkr (BCPNN) \cite{anders}. The nature of the BCPNN learning rule is such that it connects in an excitatory fashion patterns that more often that not appear together (in a probabilistic sense) and connects in an inhibitory fashion patterns that do not. More importantly for sequence disambiguation the BCPNN automatically accounts for balanced connections in sequential forks. 

\begin{align*}
t \dfrac{d \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{pre}}{dt} &= \vec{\mathbf{z}}_{pre} - \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{pre}  
 \\
 t\dfrac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} &= \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{pre} \otimes \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{post} -\mathbf{P}  \\ 
 t\dfrac{d\vec{\mathbf{p}}_{post}}{dt} &= \vec{\mathbf{z}}_{post} - \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{post}  \\
 \mathbf{W} &= \log \left(\frac{\mathbf{P}}{\vec{\mathbf{p}}_{pre} \otimes \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{post}} \right)  \\ 
 \vec{\mathbf{\beta}} &= \log \left( \vec{\mathbf{p}}_{post}  \right) 
\end{align*}
